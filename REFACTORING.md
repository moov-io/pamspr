# PAM SPR Refactoring Project

## Overview
This document tracks the refactoring effort to improve code maintainability and readability while preserving all existing test coverage.

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Centralize Field Position Definitions ⭐ **[IN PROGRESS]**
**Goal**: Extract all field positions to a single source of truth

- [x] Create `field_definitions.go` with all record field mappings
- [x] Define field position constants for all record types
- [ ] Create field validation function mappings
- [ ] Update reader.go to use centralized definitions
- [ ] Update writer.go to use centralized definitions
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass

**Benefits**: 
- Eliminates manual position calculations
- Makes format changes trivial
- Single source of truth for field layout

### Phase 2: Extract Parser Logic **[PENDING]**
**Goal**: Split monolithic reader.go into focused parser modules

- [ ] Create `parsers/` directory structure
- [ ] Extract file header/trailer parsing → `file_parser.go`
- [ ] Extract ACH schedule parsing → `ach_parser.go`  
- [ ] Extract check schedule parsing → `check_parser.go`
- [ ] Extract common record parsing → `common_parser.go`
- [ ] Update reader.go to orchestrate parsers
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass

**Benefits**:
- Reduces file complexity from 550+ to ~100 lines each
- Easier to understand and modify specific record types
- Better separation of concerns

### Phase 3: Implement Record Interface Hierarchy **[PENDING]**
**Goal**: Enable polymorphic handling of records

- [ ] Define base `Record` interface
- [ ] Define `PaymentRecord` interface
- [ ] Update all record types to implement interfaces
- [ ] Refactor type assertions to use interfaces
- [ ] Update validation to work with interfaces
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates type assertions throughout codebase
- Enables easier addition of new record types
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Phase 4: Unify Writer Field Formatting **[PENDING]**
**Goal**: Create reusable formatting system

- [ ] Design `FieldFormatter` with reflection support
- [ ] Add struct tags for field formatting rules
- [ ] Extract formatting logic from writer methods
- [ ] Implement automatic field padding/alignment
- [ ] Update all writer methods to use formatter
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplicated formatting logic
- Consistent field handling across all records
- Easier to maintain formatting rules

## Progress Tracking

| Phase | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Integration Tests | ✅ DONE | 2024-12-19 | 2024-12-19 | Tests created, baseline established |
| Phase 1 | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 2024-12-19 | - | Field positions next |
| Phase 2 | ⏸️ PENDING | - | - | Depends on Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | ⏸️ PENDING | - | - | Depends on Phase 2 |
| Phase 4 | ⏸️ PENDING | - | - | Can run parallel to 3 |

## Testing Strategy

### Before Each Phase:
1. Run full test suite: `go test ./pkg/pamspr/ -v`
2. Create snapshot of current behavior
3. Document any edge cases found

### During Refactoring:
1. Keep old code until new implementation passes all tests
2. Run tests after each significant change
3. Use parallel implementation approach

### After Each Phase:
1. Verify all tests pass
2. Run benchmarks to ensure no performance regression
3. Update documentation

## Code Metrics

### Current State (Baseline):
- Total Lines: ~4,200 (increased due to field definitions)
- Test Coverage: 98%+ (all core tests passing)
- File Count: 12 (added field_definitions.go + tests)
- Core Functionality: ✅ All working (Reader, Writer, Validator)

### Target State:
- Reduce average file size by 50%
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity by 30%
- Increase file count to ~15-20 (better separation)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Test Coverage**: Never modify code without running tests
2. **Incremental Changes**: One record type at a time
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain public API
4. **Performance**: Benchmark critical paths
5. **Documentation**: Update as we go

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-19 | Start with field positions | Highest impact, lowest risk |
| 2024-12-19 | Create centralized field definitions | Single source of truth for all 850-char records |
| TBD | Use interfaces over concrete types | Future extensibility |
